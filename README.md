# Week6
Creating plots using Python code
First uploading the library to create the plot is needed:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

After that when we want to calculate the mean value of the Load Vector we can find it through this code:
np.mean (Load_Vector)

To calculate to the standard deviation of the Load Vector:
np.std (Load_Vector)
